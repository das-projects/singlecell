# Visualizing and Clustering 1.3M neurons, with optimizations

## Speeding up Nearest Neighbors and UMAP with CPU parallelization

We will use a machine on Google Cloud Platform.

You may wish to change the zone specified here:

```bash
export IMAGE_FAMILY="ubuntu-1804-lts"
export ZONE="us-central1-a"
export INSTANCE_NAME="$USER-scanpy"

gcloud compute instances create $INSTANCE_NAME \
  --zone=$ZONE \
  --image-family=$IMAGE_FAMILY \
  --image-project=ubuntu-os-cloud \
  --machine-type=n1-highmem-32 \
  --subnet=default \
  --network-tier=PREMIUM \
  --maintenance-policy=TERMINATE
```

Connect to the instance with the following command. Note that it may
take a few minutes before it is ready to accept connections.

```bash
gcloud compute ssh --zone $ZONE $INSTANCE_NAME
```

Install Python and other packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git python3-pip python3-tk
```

Install louvain:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libz-dev libxml2-dev && pip3 install --user louvain # takes a while to install from source
```

Install scanpy with parallel optimization (not yet merged, or released)

```bash
pip3 install setuptools_scm
git clone https://github.com/tomwhite/scanpy
(cd scanpy; git checkout -b umap_embedding_optimization_0.4dev origin/umap_embedding_optimization_0.4dev; pip3 install -e .)
```

Install umap 0.4dev with parallel optimization (not yet released)

```bash
pip3 uninstall -y umap-learn
pip3 install git+https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap@0.4dev
```

Install pynndescent so that NN can run in multiple threads

```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/lmcinnes/pynndescent
```

Update various python packages to fix numba warnings:

```bash
pip3 install colorama>=0.3.9
```

Checkout this repo in the instance to give access to the scripts.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theislab/scanpy_usage
cd scdata_usage/191113_umap_parallel
```

Copy test data to the instance. Note that you will have to change the user
(`-u`) to be your GCP project since the data is in a requester pays bucket.

```bash
gsutil -u hca-scale cp gs://ll-sc-scdata/10x/1M_neurons_filtered_gene_bc_matrices_h5.h5 1M_neurons_filtered_gene_bc_matrices_h5.h5
```

Run the analysis (optimized):

```bash
python3 cluster_130K_opt.py 1M_neurons_filtered_gene_bc_matrices_h5.h5
```

Run the analysis (optimized) on 1M cells:

```bash
python3 cluster_opt.py 1M_neurons_filtered_gene_bc_matrices_h5.h5
```

Install regular scanpy and umap 0.3:

```bash
pip3 uninstall -y scanpy umap-learn
pip3 install scanpy==1.4.4.post1
pip3 install git+https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap # fix warnings (not in umap 0.3.10)
```

Run the analysis (regular):

```bash
python3 cluster_130K.py 1M_neurons_filtered_gene_bc_matrices_h5.h5
```

Run the analysis (regular) on 1M cells:

```bash
python3 cluster.py 1M_neurons_filtered_gene_bc_matrices_h5.h5
```

_Summary: unoptimized UMAP takes 3:39 minutes,
optimized takes 1:24 minutes on 130K cells;
unoptimized UMAP takes 59 minutes,
optimized takes 22 minutes on 1M cells._

To view the figures, run the following from your local machine to copy
them locally:

```bash
gcloud compute scp --zone $ZONE --recurse $INSTANCE_NAME:scdata_usage/191113_umap_parallel/figures figures
```

## Finishing up

```bash
gcloud compute instances delete --zone $ZONE --quiet $INSTANCE_NAME
```
