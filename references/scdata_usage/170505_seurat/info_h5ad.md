Some information on the `.h5ad` result file.

```
$ h5ls ./write/pmbc3k.h5ad 
X                        Dataset {2638, 1838}
obs                      Dataset {2638}
obsm                     Dataset {2638}
raw.X                    Group
raw.var                  Dataset {13714}
uns                      Group
var                      Dataset {1838}
varm                     Dataset {1838}
```

Note that the sparse raw data is stored in a group:

```
$ h5ls write/pmbc3k.h5ad/raw.X
data                     Dataset {2238732/Inf}
indices                  Dataset {2238732/Inf}
indptr                   Dataset {2639/Inf}
```

Note that the annotation of observations and variables are stored as structured arrays:

```
$ h5ls -v ./write/pmbc3k.h5ad/obs
Opened "./write/pmbc3k.h5ad" with sec2 driver.

    Storage:   87054 logical bytes, 42051 allocated bytes, 207.02% utilization

    Type:      struct {
                   "index"            +0    16-byte null-padded ASCII string
                   "n_genes"          +16   native long
                   "percent_mito"     +24   native float
                   "n_counts"         +28   native float
                   "louvain"          +32   native signed char
               } 33 bytes
```

For categorical annotation, we store category labels (e.g., `louvain_categories`) and colors (e.g., `louvain_colors`) in the unstructured annotation. Also, we store parameters of and further unstructured annotation generated by each tools in a group named after the tool (`louvain`, `neighbors`, `pca`, `rank_gene_groups`):
```
$ h5ls write/pmbc3k.h5ad/uns
louvain                  Group
louvain_categories       Dataset {8}
louvain_colors           Dataset {8}
neighbors                Group
pca                      Group
rank_genes_groups        Group
```

The multi-dimensional annotation is treated in the same way.
```
$ h5ls -v ./write/pmbc3k.h5ad/obsm 
Opened "./write/pmbc3k.h5ad" with sec2 driver.

    Storage:   612016 logical bytes, 575607 allocated bytes, 106.33% utilization
    Filter-0:  deflate-1 OPT {4}
    Type:      struct {

                   "X_umap"           +216  [2] native double
               } 232 bytes

You might note that the neighborhood graph is stored in the unstructured annotation - however, `anndata` will still slice and recognize it. In the long run, we might have another field that treats `n_observations x n_observations` sparse matrices.
